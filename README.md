# TableStyling In CSS

Table styling in CSS involves applying styles to HTML tables to enhance their appearance and layout. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the visual presentation of elements on a webpage, and tables are no exception. Here are some common aspects of table styling using CSS:


## Features

- Borders and Border-collapse:

    Use the border property to define the borders of table elements.
    Border-collapse property helps manage the space between cells.

- Text Alignment and Padding:

    Set the alignment and padding for the content within cells.

- Hover Effects:

    Enhance the user experience by adding hover effects to rows or cells.

- Width and Height:

    Adjust the width and height of the table, columns, or cells.

- Typography:

    Style the text within table cells using typography properties.

These are just a few examples, and the styling possibilities are extensive. CSS allows for precise control over the visual aspects of tables, helping to create clean, professional, and user-friendly designs.
